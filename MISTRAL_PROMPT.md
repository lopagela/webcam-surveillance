# Mistral prompt used in `Le Chat` for help

Base mistral prompt used in `Le Chat` for help:
```
We are building a minimal python app (using python3.11) that uses a webcam as a surveillance camera. The goal of this script is to call `print("SOMETHING MOVED")` as soon as something moves in front of the webcam.

The webcam we are using is a USB webcam, with a resolution of 720p, with a microphone mono channel. The idea is to run this python app on a raspberry, and to run it while I am away, to monitor if anyone enters in my apartment while I am away. This app will run for several days, if not weeks (so, the webcam will see the day cycles (day and night)).
